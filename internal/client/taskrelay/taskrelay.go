// Package taskrelay owns what the desktop's traffic task managers -- Exchange,
// Mirror and Preview -- do identically: track the locally relayed tasks of
// every Server Profile, pause and resume them against the Gateway, and
// reconcile local relays toward the Gateway's TrafficBinding state.
//
// The three tasks differ only in how a relay is opened and how the client
// describes a task to the desktop UI, so those are the two hooks a caller
// supplies. Each manager keeps its own wire types: the desktop bindings expose
// them to the frontend, and their JSON must stay separate.
