KubeLoop is a desktop network tool for Kubernetes development. It connects a
workstation to cluster networking so browsers, IDEs, CLIs, and SDKs can reach
Pod IPs, ClusterIP Services, and cluster DNS directly, without exposing each
workload through its own Ingress. The client must be able to reach the KubeLoop
Server API and Data Plane WebSocket endpoint over the network.

## Why KubeLoop

- **Transparent cluster access** — use real cluster addresses from ordinary local applications.
- **No kubeconfig or `kubectl` dependency** — the desktop app signs in to a KubeLoop Server and never embeds Kubernetes credentials.
- **No per-workload Ingress required** — RelayTicket-authenticated WebSockets carry traffic through a reachable KubeLoop endpoint to an assigned Data Plane.
- **Focused routing** — only discovered or configured Kubernetes routes enter the tunnel.
- **Local iteration tools** — Port Forward, Exchange, Mirror, and Preview cover outbound and inbound traffic.
- **Desktop workflow** — inspect workloads, use Pod SSH/SFTP, transfer files, and diagnose connections in one UI.
- **Cross-platform** — macOS, Windows, and Linux on amd64 and arm64.

## Install

### KubeLoop Server with Helm

Requirements:

- Kubernetes 1.25 or later and Helm 3
- For the Ingress-based example below, a client-reachable hostname routed to a Kubernetes Ingress controller

KubeLoop needs a reachable HTTP(S) API and WebSocket entry point. It can be
private or public, depending on where clients connect from. Ingress is one
option; the chart also supports Gateway API HTTPRoute. You do not need to
expose each application Service separately.

Install the released OCI chart. Helm generates and retains the RelayTicket
signing key and internal Relay Registry TLS Secret by default:

```bash
helm upgrade --install kubeloop \
  oci://ghcr.io/fqix/kube-loop/charts/kubeloop \
  --version 3.0.0 \
  --namespace kubeloop-system \
  --create-namespace \
  --set publicURL=http://kubeloop.example.com \
  --set ingress.enabled=true \
  --set ingress.host=kubeloop.example.com \
  --set ingress.className=nginx \
  --set controlPlane.image.repository=ghcr.io/fqix/kube-loop/control-plane \
  --set dataPlane.image.repository=ghcr.io/fqix/kube-loop/gateway \
  --set operator.image.repository=ghcr.io/fqix/kube-loop/operator \
  --wait
```

Replace the version, hostname, and Ingress class for your environment. Then
inspect the generated initial-admin instructions and verify service discovery:

```bash
helm get notes kubeloop --namespace kubeloop-system
curl http://kubeloop.example.com/.well-known/kubeloop
```

Ingress TLS is disabled by default. For HTTPS, set `publicURL` to `https://…`,
set `ingress.tls.enabled=true`, and provide `ingress.tls.secretName`.

For 3.0, upgrade the client, Gateway, and Control Plane together. Disabling
Traffic Task Noise encryption does not restore compatibility with the 2.x
transport or control protocol. RelayTicket TTL must be between 15 seconds and
1 minute. Use HTTPS/WSS for connections over untrusted networks.

Uninstall the workloads with:

```bash
helm uninstall kubeloop --namespace kubeloop-system --wait
```

The chart removes its workloads and chart-created SQLite PVC, but intentionally
retains its CRD and generated authentication/bootstrap Secrets. See the
[full Helm guide](charts/kubeloop/README.md) for key generation, Gateway API,
external PostgreSQL/MySQL, upgrades, and complete cleanup.

### Desktop client

#### macOS and Linux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fqix/kube-loop/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

To select a version or Linux package format:

```bash
VERSION=v3.0.0 PACKAGE=deb \
  bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fqix/kube-loop/main/scripts/install.sh)"
```

`PACKAGE` may be `deb`, `rpm`, or `tarball`.
On Debian/Ubuntu, the installer waits up to 300 seconds for unattended upgrades
or another package manager to release the dpkg lock. Override this with
`APT_LOCK_TIMEOUT` when needed; do not remove dpkg lock files manually.

Homebrew is also supported:

```bash
brew tap kube-loop/kubeloop https://github.com/fqix/kube-loop
brew install --cask kube-loop/kubeloop/kubeloop-desktop
```

#### Windows

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fqix/kube-loop/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

DMG, NSIS, portable zip, deb, rpm, and tar.gz artifacts are available from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/fqix/kube-loop/releases/latest).
Each release includes `SHA256SUMS`.

### Terminal client

The K9s-style terminal client implements the core connection and Kubernetes
resource workflows without requiring the desktop UI.

On macOS or Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fqix/kube-loop/main/scripts/install-tui.sh | bash
```

On Windows:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fqix/kube-loop/main/scripts/install-tui.ps1 | iex
```

Set the `VERSION` environment variable (for example, `export VERSION=v3.0.0`
in a POSIX shell or `$env:VERSION = "v3.0.0"` in PowerShell) before running the
installer to select a specific release. The installers select the
matching `kubeloop-tui-<version>-<os>-<arch>.tar.gz` archive and verify it using
the release `SHA256SUMS` before installing `kubeloop` (`kubeloop.exe` on Windows).

Release archives are available for macOS, Windows, and Linux on amd64 and
arm64. The TUI uses the same KubeLoop Server profiles and Control Plane APIs as
the desktop client; it does not read kubeconfig or call Kubernetes directly.
See the [TUI guide](docs/tui.md) for resources, commands, configuration, and
testing boundaries.

Homebrew installs the `kubeloop-tui` Formula separately from the
`kubeloop-desktop` Cask. The Formula still provides the `kubeloop` command:

```bash
brew tap kube-loop/kubeloop https://github.com/fqix/kube-loop
brew install --formula kube-loop/kubeloop/kubeloop-tui
```

## Connect

1. Open KubeLoop, add the HTTP or HTTPS URL of a KubeLoop Server, and run discovery.
2. Sign in through the system browser and choose an authorized Namespace.
3. Choose **SOCKS5 proxy** or **TUN mode**, then click **Connect**.
4. For TUN only, approve installation of the local network Helper on first use.

In TUN mode, applications use the configured cluster routes and split DNS.
In SOCKS5 mode, configure each application to use KubeLoop’s local SOCKS5 proxy;
applications that do not use the proxy are unaffected. For cluster DNS names,
use proxy-side name resolution (for example, `socks5h` in curl).

## Development workflows

| Workflow | Traffic path | Use it to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Transparent access | Local app → cluster | Open internal Services or debug Pod IPs directly |
| Port Forward | Local port → Pod or Service | Expose one cluster port on `localhost` |
| Exchange | Existing Service → local app | Replace Service backends while preserving ClusterIP and DNS |
| Mirror | Existing Service → Pods + local shadow | Observe a copy without putting the local app on the primary path |
| Preview | New temporary Service → local app | Make a local application reachable from the cluster |
| Pod SSH/SFTP | Local SSH client → `pods/exec` | Use a shell or transfer files without running `sshd` in the container |

KubeLoop restores or removes affected Services, Endpoints, and EndpointSlices
when a workflow stops or the cluster connection closes.

## Architecture

```text
Local applications
  → TUN or SOCKS5 + managed sing-box / split DNS
  → RelayTicket-authenticated Trojan over WebSocket
  → assigned, Session-scoped Gateway
  → Pods / Services / CoreDNS
```

The **Control Plane** owns authentication, policy, Cluster Session state, task
ownership, and Kubernetes operations. The **Gateway** carries forward traffic
over Trojan/WebSocket and reverse Tasks over the control WebSocket; it holds no Kubernetes
credentials. The local
**Helper** is used only by TUN mode to manage KubeLoop's sing-box process,
interface, routes, split DNS, and recovery state; SOCKS mode requires no
privileged Helper.

Read [System design](docs/design.md) and
[Trojan-over-WebSocket data plane](docs/adr/0024-v3-trojan-over-websocket-data-plane.md) for the full
control-plane, data-plane, and recovery model.

## Pod SSH

Pod SSH uses a loopback, public-key-only endpoint without installing `sshd` in
a container. KubeLoop authenticates the local SSH client and maps the channel
to the active Cluster Session's Control Plane `pods/exec` task.

- The SSH login name selects the container; it does not change the process user.
- Interactive shells and remote commands require `/bin/sh`.
- SFTP and modern `scp` clients using SFTP use the built-in adapter. The container needs `/bin/sh` and `tar`; listing and metadata operations also require commands such as `ls`, `chmod`, and `truncate`.
- KubeLoop can create a missing `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` without overwriting an existing identity.
- Disconnecting removes runtime-only SSH endpoints without modifying Pods.

## MCP for editors and agents

KubeLoop can expose a local
[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server over
Streamable HTTP for Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, and VS Code.

MCP is disabled by default, listens only on `127.0.0.1`, and uses a generated
Bearer token. Cluster operations use the active authenticated Server Profile and
Cluster Session; MCP does not load a local kubeconfig or bypass Control Plane
policy and Kubernetes authorization.

| Tool | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| `manage_cluster` | Read cluster capabilities; list Namespaces, Services, and Pods |
| `manage_connection` | Read, connect, or explicitly disconnect the active Session |
| `manage_traffic` | Start, stop, and list Port Forward, Exchange, Mirror, and Preview Tasks |
| `exec_pod_command` | Execute an exact argv through the authenticated Control Plane exec stream; output is base64 |
| `manage_file_transfer` | Start, list, or cancel local ↔ Pod transfers |
| `manage_pod_files` | List, create, rename, or delete Pod files and directories |

See the [website MCP guide](https://fqix.github.io/kube-loop/#/mcp) for setup.

## Build from source

Requirements:

- Go version declared in [`go.mod`](go.mod)
- Node.js 22+
- NSIS, to build the Windows installer

```bash
make desktop-install    # install the workspace dependencies
make desktop-run        # run the desktop app
make desktop-package    # package the desktop app for this platform
make test-local         # run non-E2E tests and vet
make vulncheck          # check Go dependencies for known vulnerabilities
```

The desktop app is an Electron shell around a Go sidecar
([`cmd/kubeloop-desktop-host`](cmd/kubeloop-desktop-host)), which serves the
application bindings over a loopback JSON-RPC endpoint. See
[`desktop/README.md`](desktop/README.md) for details.

Useful workspace commands, from the repository root:

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev          # desktop app (Electron shell)
npm run dev:admin    # admin console
npm run dev:auth     # auth page
npm run dev:site     # public website
npm run build:site   # writes the production site to ./site
```

The Admin Console, auth page, and public website all use React, Vite,
Tailwind CSS 4, and shadcn conventions. GitHub Pages rebuilds the website
before deployment.
